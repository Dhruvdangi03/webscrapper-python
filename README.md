# webscrapper-python
This Django project utilizes Selenium and PostgreSQL as its key components.It focuses solely on data scraping without any elaborate styling.

The core functionality of the project revolves around receiving a URL and an XPath as inputs. Using Selenium, the project accesses the provided URL and navigates through its content. It then locates the specified XPath within the webpage's structure. Selenium's robust web automation capabilities enable the project to interact with the page and retrieve the desired data.

To store the scraped data, the project employs PostgreSQL as its database system. PostgreSQL provides a reliable and scalable solution for persistently storing the extracted information.

Overall, this project combines the power of Django, Selenium, and PostgreSQL to create a streamlined data scraping application. Its primary purpose is to retrieve data from a specified URL using a given XPath, demonstrating how these technologies can be integrated to automate data extraction tasks efficiently.
